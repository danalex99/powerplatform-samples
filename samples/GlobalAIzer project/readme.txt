Problem Statement:
In a diverse and interconnected world, visually impaired individuals often face challenges accessing written content, especially when presented in unfamiliar languages or non-accessible formats such as handwritten notes or PDFs.

Solution Overview:
My Power Apps Canvas app leverages advanced AI technologies to recognize, translate, and audibly relay written content. With an intuitive interface via PowerApps, users can effortlessly translate text from diverse sources into their preferred language and receive the translated content audibly, ensuring information is always accessible.


AI Features Utilized:
Text Recognizer prebuilt model (AI Builder): Enables the identification and extraction of text from various formats, including handwritten documents and PDFs. This ensures that written content, regardless of its origin, can be made accessible.

Azure Cognitive Services - Microsoft Translator: Once text is recognized, it's seamlessly translated into the user's chosen language, accommodating a vast array of global languages and dialects.

Text-to-Speech Capabilities offered by the Microsoft Partner Apptigent (Connector): Beyond simple translation, the app empowers users to hear the translated content, providing an auditory experience that caters to individuals with visual impairments.
